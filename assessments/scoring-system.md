# Postural Scoring System (0-10 Scale)

Standardized scoring methodology for quantifying postural dysfunction.

## 🎯 Overall Score Interpretation

| Score | Category | Description | Action Required |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | Optimal alignment, minimal deviation | Maintenance only |
| 7-8 | Good | Minor deviations, no pain | Preventive exercises |
| 5-6 | Fair | Moderate dysfunction, occasional discomfort | Active correction program |
| 3-4 | Poor | Significant dysfunction, regular pain | Intensive rehabilitation |
| 1-2 | Severe | Critical dysfunction, chronic pain | Medical evaluation + intensive program |
| 0 | Critical | Pathological, severe pain/disability | Immediate medical intervention |

## 🧮 Calculating Total Score

### Weighted Formula

```
Total Score = (Cervical × 0.20) + 
              (Scapular × 0.20) + 
              (Thoracic × 0.20) + 
              (Lumbar × 0.15) + 
              (Core × 0.15) + 
              (Symmetry × 0.10)
```

### Example Calculation

| Region | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Cervical | 3 | 20% | 0.6 |
| Scapular | 4 | 20% | 0.8 |
| Thoracic | 2 | 20% | 0.4 |
| Lumbar | 5 | 15% | 0.75 |
| Core | 3 | 15% | 0.45 |
| Symmetry | 4 | 10% | 0.4 |

**Total Score: 3.4/10 (Poor - Requires intensive intervention)**

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID)
- **1.0 point improvement** = Noticeable subjective change
- **2.0 points improvement** = Significant objective change
- **3.0+ points improvement** = Major transformation

### Expected Progression Rates

**With High Compliance (90%+):**
- **Weeks 0-4:** +0.5-1.0 points
- **Weeks 4-8:** +1.0-1.5 points
- **Weeks 8-12:** +0.5-1.0 points
- **Weeks 12-24:** +0.5-1.0 points

**With Moderate Compliance (70-90%):**
- Expect 50-75% of above rates

**With Low Compliance (<70%):**
- Minimal to no improvement

## 📊 Using the Score

### Initial Assessment
1. Score all 6 regions independently
2. Calculate weighted total
3. Identify worst-performing regions
4. Prioritize intervention

### Reassessment Schedule
- **Week 4:** Quick check (photos + key measurements)
- **Week 8:** Mid-program assessment
- **Week 12:** Full reassessment
- **Every 12 weeks:** Comprehensive evaluation

### Score-Based Protocol Selection

| Score | Recommended Protocol |
|-------|---------------------|
| 7-10 | Maintenance + prevention |
| 5-6 | Standard correction program |
| 3-4 | Intensive protocol (current) |
| 1-2 | Medical clearance + intensive protocol + supervision |
| 0 | Medical intervention required |
